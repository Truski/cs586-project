Deliverable #2: Class responsibilities and operations

GasPump1
This class is the first gas pump platform. It is used as an input processor in the MDA. It receives input from driver

Operations:
Initialize(AbstractFactory af): Initializes the gas pump with the given factory, and initializes the mdaefsm
Activate (float a, float b) // the gas pump is activated where a is the price of the Regular gas
                            // and b is the price of Diesel gas per gallon
Start() //start the transaction
PayCredit() // pay for gas by a credit card
Reject() // credit card is rejected
PayDebit(string p) // pay for gas by a debit card, where p is a pin #
Pin(string x) // pin # is provided, where x represents the pin #
Cancel() // cancel the transaction
Approved() // credit card is approved
Diesel() // Diesel gas is selected
Regular() // Regular gas is selected
StartPump() // start pumping gas
PumpGallon() // one gallon of gas is disposed
StopPump() // stop pumping gas
FullTank() // Tank is full and pump is stopped

GasPump2
This class is the second gas pump platform. It is used as an input processor in the MDA. It receives input from driver

Operations:
Initialize(AbstractFactory af): Initializes the gas pump with the given factory, and initializes the mdaefsm
Activate (float a, float b, float c) // the gas pump is activated where a is the price of Super gas, b is
                                     //the price of Regular gas and c is the price of Premium gas per liter
PayCash(int c) // pay for gas by cash, where c represents prepaid cash
PayCredit() // pay for gas by a credit card
Approved() // credit card is approved
Reject() // credit card is rejected
Cancel() // cancel the transaction
Premium() // Premium gas is selected
Regular() // Regular gas is selected
Super() // Super gas is selected
StartPump() // start pumping gas
PumpLiter() // one liter of gas is disposed
Stop() // stop pumping gas
Receipt() // Receipt is requested
NoReceipt() // No receipt

AbstractFactory
Creates the appropriate strategies and Data Store

Operations:
- getDataStore: Returns the appropriate data store (based on which concrete factory is created).
If the datastore hasn't been created yet, it will be made here.
- CreateStrategyX: For each X-named Strategy, returns the appropriate strategy object depending on concrete factory

ConcreteFactory1
Creates strategies(actions) and data store for GasPump1

Operations:
- getDataStore: Returns the DataStore1 (creates it first if doesn't exist)
- CreateStrategyX: For each X-namedStrategy, returns the action that GasPump1 takes in its OutputProcessor

ConcreteFactory2
Creates strategies(actions) and data store for GasPump2

Operations:
- getDataStore: Returns the DataStore2 (creates it first if doesn't exist)
- CreateStrategyX: For each X-namedStrategy, returns the action that GasPump2 takes in its OutputProcessor

DataStore
The abstract DataStore class that has abstract methods for getting and setting all possible variables

Operations:
- get_data_X: For each data field X, returns the value of X
- set_data_X: For each data field X, allows the user to set the value of X

DataStore1
The concrete DataStore for GasPump1, containing all required data fields

Operations:
- get_data_X: For each data field X, returns the value of X. X values that DataStore1 does not have are not implemented
- set_data_X: For each data field X, allows the user to set the value of X. X values that DataStore1 does not have are not implemented

DataStore2
The concrete DataStore for GasPump2, containing all required data fields

Operations:
- get_data_X: For each data field X, returns the value of X. X values that DataStore2 does not have are not implemented
- set_data_X: For each data field X, allows the user to set the value of X. X values that DataStore2 does not have are not implemented

Driver (Not included in class diagram)
This class is responsible for the Main Method. It allows the user to select the gas pump and enter commands and parameters

Operations:
- main: The entry point for the software system

MDAEFSM
The Platform Independent Model in the MDA. Contains the state pattern (states and current state) and the data M (for determining prices)

Operations:
- getM, setM: Getters and setters for M
- Initialize: Initializes the state machine by creating the states, setting the initial state, and initializing the output processor with the abstract factory
- setState: allows state classes to change the state of the mdaefsm (decentralized state pattern)
- Activate, Start, PayType, and the remaining operations: These are the meta events for the MDAEFSM, and they are forwarded to the current state object

OutputProcessor
This class is the OP of the Model Driven Architecture. It is initialized via an abstract factory that returns the appropriate strategies. States have access to the OP and can call its actions

Operations:
- Initialize: Initializes the OP by calling all of the Factory's CreateStrategyX methods, and gets the Data Store used by the system
- StorePrices, PayMsg, StoreCash, and the remaining operations: these are the meta actions, and forward the call to the strategy initialized
- StorePrices // stores price(s) for the gas from the temporary data store
- PayMsg // displays a type of payment method
- StoreCash // stores cash from the temporary data store
- DisplayMenu // display a menu with a list of selections
- RejectMsg // displays credit card not approved message
- SetPrice(int g, int M) // set the price for the gas identified by g identifier as in SelectGas(int g); if M=1, the price may be increased
- ReadyMsg // displays the ready for pumping message
- SetInitialValues // set G (or L) and total to 0;
- PumpGasUnit // disposes unit of gas and counts # of units disposed
- GasPumpedMsg // displays the amount of disposed gas
- StopMsg // stop pump message and receipt? msg (optionally)
- PrintReceipt // print a receipt
- CancelMsg // displays a cancellation message
- ReturnCash // returns the remaining cash
- WrongPinMsg // displays incorrect pin message
- StorePin // stores the pin from the temporary data store
- EnterPinMsg // displays a message to enter pin
- InitializeData // set the value of price and cash to 0

State
The abstract class for states in the state pattern. Has pointer to the OP for states to call actions and MDAEFSM to change state and change platform independent data (M)

Operations:
- setOP: Sets the OP pointer during initialization
- setMDAEFSM: Sets the MDAEFSM pointer during initialization
- Activate, Start, PayType, and the other operations: Events that the states can receive and respond to

Classes S0 through S8
These are the concrete states in the State pattern. They all override the abstract events in State. Based on the Platform Independent Model (MDAEFSM diagram), these states will call actions to occur and change the MDAEFSM's state
Operations in these classes are the same as State since they inherit them. Only the state-event combinations that comply to our MDAEFSM diagram are implemented with code

Operations:
- Activate, Start, PayType, and the other operations: Events that the states can receive and do actions based upon

The remaining classes (Strategies)
Each strategy has 3 classes: 1 abstract class with one abstract method, and 2 classes that override the implementation (1 for each gas pump)
Since in my design, both gas pumps has their own versions of menus and messages, there were 3 classes for each strategy instead of just 2 for some (sharing)
The abstract strategies allow us to easily add new gas pumps and their implementations of actions. They are called via the output processor
The concrete strategies are created based on the Concrete Factory in the Abstract Factory Pattern

Here is a list of the strategies and their description of their operation (Detailed descriptions of what they do are pseudocode - please see source):

Initialize: Initializes the OP by calling all of the Factory's CreateStrategyX methods, and gets the Data Store used by the system

StorePrices, PayMsg, StoreCash, and the remaining operations: these are the meta actions, and forward the call to the strategy initialized

StorePrices // stores price(s) for the gas from the temporary data store

PayMsg // displays a type of payment method

StoreCash // stores cash from the temporary data store

DisplayMenu // display a menu with a list of selections

RejectMsg // displays credit card not approved message

SetPrice(int g, int M) // set the price for the gas identified by g identifier as in SelectGas(int g); if M=1, the price may be increased

ReadyMsg // displays the ready for pumping message

SetInitialValues // set G (or L) and total to 0;

PumpGasUnit // disposes unit of gas and counts # of units disposed

GasPumpedMsg // displays the amount of disposed gas

StopMsg // stop pump message and receipt? msg (optionally)

PrintReceipt // print a receipt

CancelMsg // displays a cancellation message
